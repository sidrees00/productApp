<h2>Products</h2>

<div *ngFor="let product of products">
    <h3>{{product.name}}</h3>
</div>

<!-- Tip: *ngFor is a "structural directive". Structural directives shape or reshape the DOM's structure, typically by adding, removing, and manipulating the elements to which they are attached. Any directive with an * is a structural directive. -->
