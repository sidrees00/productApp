<!-- 
  Notes: 
  
  1) *ngFor is a "structural directive". Structural directives shape or reshape the DOM's structure, typically by adding, removing, and manipulating the elements to which they are attached. Any directive with an * is a structural directive.

  2) When you put an anchor within a heading, the anchor will adopt the styles of the heading.

  3) Interpolation looks for the specified property value on the class and returns its string value.  
  
  4) Template expression = anything within " " inside of an HTML or template file.
  
  5) Property binding [], lets you use the property value within a template expression.  
  
  6) The above title attribute can also be defined as: title="{{product.name}} details".

  7) The routerLink defines how the user navigates to the route (or URL) declaratively in the component template.

  8) The RouterLink directive gives the router control over the anchor element. In this case, the route (URL) contains one fixed segment (/products) and the final segment is variable, inserting the id property of the current product.
